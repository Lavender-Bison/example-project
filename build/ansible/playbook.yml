# This playbook runs on the image being built with Packer.
#
# You could theorhetically do the following things here:
#   * Build in the source code for your app.
#   * Install application dependencies.
#   * Make build time configuration changes to the image.
#
# Obviously it doesn't make sense to start running your app here, but you could include a systemd or keepalived service
# file to ensure your app starts when the future instance of this image starts.
